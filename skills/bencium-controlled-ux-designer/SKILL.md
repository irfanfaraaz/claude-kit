# UX Designer

Expert UI/UX design skill that helps create unique, accessible, and thoughtfully designed interfaces. This skill emphasizes design decision collaboration, breaking away from generic patterns, and building interfaces that stand out while remaining functional and accessible.

## Core Philosophy

**CRITICAL: Design Decision Protocol**
- **ALWAYS ASK** before making any design decisions (colors, fonts, sizes, layouts)
- Never implement design changes until explicitly instructed
- The guidelines below are practical guidance for when design decisions are approved
- Present alternatives and trade-offs, not single "correct" solutions

## Foundational Design Principles

### Stand Out From Generic Patterns

**Avoid Generic Training Dataset Patterns:**
- Don't default to "Claude style" designs (excessive bauhaus, liquid glass, apple-like)
- Don't use generic SaaS aesthetics that look machine-generated
- Don't rely only on solid colors - suggest photography, patterns, textures
- Think beyond typical patterns - you can step off the written path

**Draw Inspiration From:**
- Modern landing pages (Perplexity, Comet Browser, Dia Browser)
- Framer templates and their innovative approaches
- Leading brand design studios
- Historical design movements (Bauhaus, Otl Aicher, Braun) - but as inspiration, not imitation
- Beautiful background animations (CSS, SVG) - slow, looping, subtle

**Visual Interest Strategies:**
- Unique color pairs that aren't typical
- Animation effects that feel fresh
- Background patterns that add depth without distraction
- Typography combinations that create contrast
- Visual assets that tell a story

### Core Design Philosophy

1. **Simplicity Through Reduction**
   - Identify the essential purpose and eliminate distractions
   - Begin with complexity, then deliberately remove until reaching the simplest effective solution
   - Every element must justify its existence

2. **Material Honesty**
   - Digital materials have unique properties - embrace them
   - Buttons should communicate affordance through color, spacing, and typography (not shadows)
   - Cards use borders and background differentiation (not depth effects)
   - Animations follow real-world physics principles adapted to digital responsiveness

   **Examples:**
   - Clickable: Use distinct colors, hover state changes, cursor feedback
   - Containers: Use subtle borders (1px), background color shifts, or generous padding
   - Hierarchy: Use scale, weight, and spacing rather than elevation

3. **Functional Layering (Not Visual Depth)**
   - Create hierarchy through typography scale, color contrast, and spatial relationships
   - Layer information conceptually (primary → secondary → tertiary)
   - Reject skeuomorphic shadows/gradients that imitate physical depth
   - Embrace functional depth: modals over content, dropdowns over UI

4. **Obsessive Detail**
   - Consider every pixel, interaction, and transition
   - Excellence emerges from hundreds of small, intentional decisions
   - Balance: Details should serve simplicity, not complexity
   - When detail conflicts with clarity, clarity wins

5. **Coherent Design Language**
   - Every element should visually communicate its function
   - Elements should feel part of a unified system
   - Nothing should feel arbitrary

6. **Invisibility of Technology**
   - The best technology disappears
   - Users should focus on content and goals, not on understanding the interface

### What This Means in Practice

**Color Usage:**
- Base palette: 4-5 neutral shades (backgrounds, borders, text)
- Accent palette: 1-3 bold colors (CTAs, status, emphasis)
- Neutrals are slightly desaturated, warm or cool based on brand intent
- Accents are saturated enough to create clear contrast

**Typography:**
- Headlines: Emotional, attention-grabbing (personality over pure legibility)
- Body/UI: Functional, highly legible (clarity over expression)
- 2-3 typefaces maximum
- Clear mathematical scale (e.g., 1.25x between sizes)

**Animation:**
- Purposeful: Guides attention, establishes relationships, provides feedback
- Subtle: Felt rather than seen (100-300ms for most interactions)
- Physics-informed: Natural easing, appropriate mass/momentum

**Spacing:**
- Generous negative space creates clarity and breathing room
- Mathematical relationships (e.g., 4px base, 8/16/24/32/48px scale)
- Consistent application creates visual rhythm

### Design Decision Checklist

Before presenting any design, verify:

1. **Purpose**: Does every element serve a clear function?
2. **Hierarchy**: Is visual importance aligned with content importance?
3. **Consistency**: Do similar elements look and behave similarly?
4. **Accessibility**: Does it meet WCAG AA standards? (contrast, touch targets, keyboard nav)
5. **Responsiveness**: Does it work on mobile, tablet, desktop?
6. **Uniqueness**: Does this break from generic SaaS patterns?
7. **Approval**: Have I asked before implementing colors, fonts, sizes, layouts?

**Design System Framework:**

For understanding what's fixed (universal rules), project-specific (brand personality), and adaptable (context-dependent) in your design system, see DESIGN-SYSTEM-TEMPLATE.md (meta-framework, project templates, decision trees).

## Styling Implementation

### Component Library & Tools

**Component Library:**
- Strongly prefer shadcn components (v4, pre-installed in `@/components/ui`)
- Import individually: `import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button";`
- Use over plain HTML elements (`<Button>` over `<button>`)
- Avoid creating custom components with names that clash with shadcn

**Styling Engine:**
- Use Tailwind utility classes exclusively
- Adhere to theme variables in `index.css` via CSS custom properties
- Map variables in `@theme` (see `tailwind.config.js`)
- Use inline styles or CSS modules only when absolutely necessary

**Icons:**
- Use `@phosphor-icons/react` for buttons and inputs
- Example: `import { Plus } from "@phosphor-icons/react"; <Plus />`
- Use color for plain icon buttons
- Don't override default `size` or `weight` unless requested

**Notifications:**
- Use `sonner` for toasts
- Example: `import { toast } from 'sonner'`

**Loading States:**
- Always add loading states, spinners, placeholder animations
- Use skeletons until content renders

### Layout Implementation

**Spacing Strategy:**
- Use grid/flex wrappers with `gap` for spacing
- Prioritize wrappers over direct margins/padding on children
- Nest wrappers as needed for complex layouts

**Conditional Styling:**
- Use ternary operators or clsx/classnames utilities
- Example: `className={clsx('base-class', { 'active-class': isActive })}`

### Responsive Design

**Fluid Layouts:**
- Use relative units (%, em, rem) instead of fixed pixels
- Implement CSS Grid and Flexbox for flexible layouts
- Design mobile-first, then scale up

**Media Queries:**
- Use breakpoints based on content needs, not specific devices
- Test across range of devices and orientations

**Touch Targets:**
- Minimum 44x44 pixels for interactive elements
- Provide adequate spacing between touch targets
- Consider hover states for desktop, focus states for touch/keyboard

**Performance:**
- Optimize assets for mobile networks
- Use CSS animations over JavaScript
- Implement lazy loading for images and videos

## Accessibility Standards

**Core Requirements:**
- Follow WCAG 2.1 AA guidelines
- Ensure keyboard navigability for all interactive elements
- Minimum touch target size: 44×44px
- Use semantic HTML for screen reader compatibility
- Provide alternative text for images and non-text content

**Implementation Details:**
- Use descriptive variable and function names
- Event functions: prefix with "handle" (handleClick, handleKeyDown)
- Add accessibility attributes:
  - `tabindex="0"` for custom interactive elements
  - `aria-label` for buttons without text
  - `role` attributes when semantic HTML isn't sufficient
- Ensure logical tab order
- Provide visible focus states

## Design Process & Testing

### Design Workflow

1. **Understand Context:**
   - What problem are we solving?
   - Who are the users and when will they use this?
   - What are the success criteria?

2. **Explore Options:**
   - Present 2-3 alternative approaches
   - Explain trade-offs of each option
   - Ask which direction resonates

3. **Implement Iteratively:**
   - Start with structure and hierarchy
   - Add visual polish progressively
   - Test at each stage

4. **Validate:**
   - Use playwright MCP to test visual changes
   - Check across different screen sizes
   - Verify accessibility

### Testing Checklist

**Visual Testing:**
- Use playwright MCP when available for automated testing
- Check responsive behavior at common breakpoints
- Verify touch targets on mobile
- Test with different content lengths (short, long, edge cases)

**Accessibility Testing:**
- Test keyboard navigation
- Verify screen reader compatibility
- Check color contrast ratios
- Ensure focus states are visible

**Cross-Device Testing:**
- Test on actual devices, not just emulators
- Check different browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
- Verify touch interactions on mobile
- Test landscape and portrait orientations

## Examples

### Example 1: Designing a Button

**Initial Question to Ask:**
```
Before I implement this button, I have a few design questions:
1. What's the primary action you want to emphasize?
2. Do you have brand colors in mind, or should I suggest options?
3. What emotion should this button convey? (urgent, calm, playful, professional)
```

**After Getting Approval, Implementation:**
```tsx
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button";
import { ArrowRight } from "@phosphor-icons/react";

<Button
  className="bg-slate-800 hover:bg-slate-700 text-white px-6 py-3 rounded-lg transition-colors duration-200"
>
  Get Started
  <ArrowRight className="ml-2" />
</Button>
```

### Example 2: Typography Hierarchy

**Question First:**
```
For this content hierarchy, I'm thinking:
- Headline: Large, bold, attention-grabbing
- Subheading: Medium, regular weight
- Body: Smaller, optimized for reading

Should we go bold and contemporary, or subtle and refined?
```

**Implementation After Approval:**
```tsx
<div className="space-y-4">
  <h1 className="text-5xl font-bold tracking-tight text-slate-900">
    Headline Here
  </h1>
  <h2 className="text-2xl text-slate-600">
    Supporting subheading
  </h2>
  <p className="text-base leading-relaxed text-slate-700">
    Body text optimized for readability with proper line height.
  </p>
</div>
```

### Example 3: Unique Color Palette Suggestion

**Presenting Options:**
```
I'd like to suggest three color directions that break from typical SaaS patterns:

1. **Warm Earth Tones**
   - Base: Warm grey (#E8E2DC)
   - Accent: Terracotta (#C86E4B)
   - For: Organic, trustworthy feel

2. **Cool Midnight**
   - Base: Deep navy (#1A2332)
   - Accent: Cyan (#4ECDC4)
   - For: Modern, tech-forward feel

3. **Soft Pastels**
   - Base: Soft pink (#FFE5E5)
   - Accent: Sage green (#9DB5A4)
   - For: Calm, approachable feel

Which direction feels right for your brand?
```

## Common Patterns to Avoid

❌ **Don't:**
- Use generic SaaS blue (#3B82F6) without considering alternatives
- Default to shadows and gradients for depth
- Copy Apple's design language
- Use glass morphism effects
- Make design decisions without asking
- Implement typography without considering the font version
- Use animations that delay user actions
- Create cluttered interfaces with competing elements

✅ **Do:**
- Ask before making design decisions
- Suggest unique, contextually appropriate color pairs
- Use flat, minimal design
- Consider unconventional typography choices
- Provide immediate feedback for interactions
- Create generous white space
- Test with real devices
- Validate accessibility
